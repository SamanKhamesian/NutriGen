It's important to note that these meal plans are estimates and do not precisely meet the target macros, especially the high sugar target.  Accurate nutritional information for each specific brand and preparation method is required for a precise and balanced plan.  Consulting a registered dietitian or nutritionist is recommended for personalized dietary guidance.
