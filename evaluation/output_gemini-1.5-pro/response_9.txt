**Important Notes:**

* These calorie estimates are approximations based on general values for similar foods.  Actual calorie content can vary. It's highly recommended to check the specific nutritional information of the products you use.
* These meal plans rely heavily on packaged/prepared foods. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains should be incorporated whenever possible for a more balanced and nutritious diet.
* The provided list of food items makes it difficult to precisely meet the protein target without additional protein sources.
* Because specific nutritional information for the provided food items isn't available, accurate totals for fat, protein, and carbohydrate cannot be calculated. It is *crucial* to review the nutritional labels of the specific foods you use to ensure they align with your targets.


Using a wider variety of ingredients will make it much easier to create meal plans that accurately meet your targets and provide a more balanced nutritional profile.  Consider consulting a nutritionist or dietitian for personalized advice.
